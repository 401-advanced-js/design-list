- Work in a fork of your “sass-design” repository in your github account
- Create a <Button /> comonent that takes the following props:
- onClick - Method to run on click
- href - Remote destination
- text - Display Text
  Type - primary, secondary, etc
  Use SASS Modules to provide custom styling (and options) with your components
  Buttons will be styled differently depending on where and how they are used, what type they are, etc.
  The task here is to use the props to get it right
  The component rendering the button has the responsibility of knowing what right is.
  Plan for many classes and rules – modularize this and make use of mixins to provide an easy means of differentiation.
